## My shiny app  
This shiny application help one to understand the [central limited theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), this app runs in [shinyapps.io](https://adalee.shinyapps.io/central_limited_theorem). For how to use it, I have created a [online slide](http://adalee2future.github.io/shiny-app/) to demonstrate this app, the slide was writen by r markdown (Rmd) and convert to html5 slide using [slidify](http://slidify.github.io/)
